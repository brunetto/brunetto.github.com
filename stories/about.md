# For future reference...

... is the main reason because I try to keep this blog alive! Just to save knowledge about useful things to have them when they are needed again.    
The second is just... to do it because I like the "[technology](../posts/blogging-with-nikola-ipython-github.html)" behind it!:P

# Me

My name is [Brunetto Ziosi](https://plus.google.com/+BrunettoZiosi)<!--(https://plus.google.com/117554238100031566866)--> 
and I'm a [PhD student in Astronomy](http://www.dfa.unipd.it/index.php?id=1051) ([CV](curriculum-vitae.html))
at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.dfa.unipd.it/) of the [University of Padua](http://www.unipd.it/).    
My [PhD project](research/research.html) is about the formation and evolution of compact objects 
(i.e. neutron stars and black holes) binaries in young star clusters. 
These binaries are thought to be the most promising sources of detectable gravitational waves.    
See the [research](research/research.html) page for more information.    
My master thesis was about creating a Python code to calculate the two point correlation 
function for dark matter haloes, subhaloes and dark matter, and apply it to the Millenium II simulation outputs.    
I'm also a [scout](personal/scout.html) leader in the AGESCI association, a [traveller](travels/travels.html)
(by [moto](moto.html), [feet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_St._James), airplane, ...) and a [registered linux user](https://linuxcounter.net) 
with registration number [508678](http://linuxcounter.net/user/508678.html).    
I'm still try to [play an instrument](personal/multimedia/music.html)!:P    
Sometimes I [try to do something in the kitchen](personal/cooking.html) without creating a black hole
or violating any nature law!:P    
Of course, I own an [Android](tech/android.html) phone.    
    
I like:    
    
* the nice smell of the wood in the mountain forest
* wooden and glass surfaces
* obviously, to dip my hand into a sack of beans
* [riding my motorbike](travels/moto.html) [across the Europe with the DDteam](travels/travels.html)
* [make the computer](tech/system-tricks.html) [work for me](tech/programming-links.html)
* [take photos and experiment with them](personal/multimedia/photos.html), 
maybe [create videos](personal/multimedia/videos.html) or [timelapses](personal/multimedia/timelapses.html)
* Eating [piadina](https://www.facebook.com/LaTuaPiadina), [pizza](http://www.ai4elementi.com/) and [ice cream](http://www.cremeriafunivia.com/)
and drinking [beer](http://www.birrachimera.com/)
* to be continued...:P

Here you can also find a link to [my favourite quotes](personal/my-favourite-quotes.html), [PhD Comics](personal/my-favourite-phd-comics.html)
 and my [wish-list](personal/wish-list.html).    
[Here](tech/sites-making-notes.html) some notes on making sites.    
I am not good in languages, neverthless sometimes I found 
[something worth remembering](languages.html).    

Sometimes, someone says that I'm quite nerd.....!:P

# License

I'm quite a lazy person in some things. One of these is the license question.

For now you can think about all the material I post here as covered by some kind 
of the GPLx or the CC licenses, that is, you can use and modify what you find here 
for free but I would like if you cite me as reference!

Moreover, I try to put references for things I found anywhere and post here, 
if you have any doubt or you find my citations wrong, feel free to ask me!:)
