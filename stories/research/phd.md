**The impact of stellar evolution and dynamics on the formation of 
compact-object binaries**

I am working on N-body simulations of young and dense star clusters in order to 
understand the impact of stellar evolution and dynamics on the formation and evolution 
of compact-object (neutron stars and black holes) binary systems.     
These objects are thought to be the best candidates to produce gravitational 
waves observable in the near future with the second-generation ground-based 
gravitational wave interferometers Advanced Ligo and Virgo.
