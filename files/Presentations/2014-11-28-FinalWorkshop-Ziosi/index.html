As the picture suggests, my work sits among three main topics: stellar evolution, dynamics and gravitational waves.
In the first part of this talk I will give you some basic notions about them.
In the second part I will show you my work focusing on three aspects: 
the role of i) dynamics and metallicity, ii) a galactic tidal field and iii) different structural properties of SCs on the formation and evolution of double compact object binaries.

* As I touch on in the talk title, our simulations involve YSCs as environments.
The first reason is that YSC are the birthplace for about 80% of stars in the local universe, so it is reasonable to take them into account as environment for our simulations. The amazing picture shows to young star clusters, the Arches and the Quintuplet, captured by HST.

to be collisional, that is, to have efficient dynamical interactions among stars. Thus they have an intense dynamical activity so they are excellent environments where to study how dynamics impact on binaries.

???

* The most interesting aspect of dynamics for this project are 3-body stellar encounters.
A 3bd encounter is a close encounter between a single object and a binary: if the kinetic energy is transferred from the binary to the single object the binary SMA decrease. This process is called hardening and it more lokely for binaries already hard.
* Another possivle outcome of a 3bd encounter is the exchange, that is when a single star take the place of one of the component of the binary. The probabilityfor an exchange to occur is proportional to the ratio between the mass of the intruder and the mass of the component of the binary. 
* Because BH have large masses they have high probability to acquire a companion through 3bd exchange.

* "Hard" binary: `$ \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{2a}\geq\frac{1}{2}\langle m\rangle \sigma^2$`

There's something else.
* This plot here shows the BH mass as a function of the final mass of the progenitor.
* The red line shows the relation between the two for low-Z stars and they are significantly 
different from the others.
* Stars with `$M_{fin} ≥ 40M_\odot$` are
expected to collapse directly to a BH
without SN explosion
* BHs formed from through this process 
are more massive than BHs
formed from SN explosion 
* Because metal-poor stars lose less mass by
stellar winds ⇒ more likely to
collapse to BH directly

## Dynamics and metallicity
</br></br>
![dynAndMet](images/meanDCOBandMass.svg)

???

Here realizes what I told you before about stellar evolution and dynamics:
* Taking into account the new stellar evolution recipes we find higher BH masses at lower metallicity
* the plot shows the number of BH for each mass interval as a function of the metallicity.
* These BHs are more efficient in acquiring a companion through 3bd exchanges leading to the early formation of more stable binaries respect to higher metallicities. This can be seen here (figure).
* Just to give you an idea, 97% of DBH binaries come from exchanges while this is true only for 13% of DNS 
* Moreover, you can see in the inset, dynamics is responsible for the presence of 10 times more DBH binaries than DNS ones despite the IMF

* From the coalescence timescales, using a Drake-like equation, we derive the merger rates (as a function of the metallicity.
* It is worth nothing that the BHs merger rate drop 
at high metallicities because of the smaller masses of the BHs, while the NS merger rate has the opposite trend.

The results I obtained, however, stand on two critical assumptions:

* SCs live **unperturbed** in **isolation** for 100 Myr

* Random realizations of a **single SC model** 

Both these assumptions can heavily affect our estimate of BH demographics.

We obtained nice results, but they rely on two critical assumptions:

and they can heavily affect our estimates.

These are some preliminary results: 
* on the right the table with the values for these simulations, 

* Upper left plot: average number of BH-BH binaries per cluster for different sets of initial structural parameters, integrated over the  ~100 Myr duration of the simulations
* Bottom left panel: averge number of BH-BH binaries per cluster per Myr
* c28 shows a peak PROBABLY due to and intense exchange activity at ~ 25 Myr
* In both the panels c60, the loosest cluster type, has the lowest number of
BH-BH binaries
* On the left: coalescence timescale (tGW) [is the time a system needs to reach semi-major axis a=0 due to orbital decay by GW emission (Peters 1964)]
* Only two simulated BH-BH have `$t_{GW}< t_{H}$` (where tH is the Hubble time), and thus could be important for GW detection
* The system with a~5x10-2 AU in c60
* A very eccentric and unstable system in c28 that will break before the end of the simulation

# Conclusions
]

* I analyzed 600 simulations to study the impact of dynamics and metallicity on the formation and evolution of 
DCOBs .citation[(Ziosi+2014)]: 

	* Low metallicity favours the **early** formation of **heavy** and **stable** BH-BH binaries
	
	* It's likely that a massive BH **acquires a companion** through **dynamical exchanges**
	
	* Metallicity has a role in determining the final **merger rates**
