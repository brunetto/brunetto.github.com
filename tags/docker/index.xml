      <description>What is Docker? In short:
 &amp;ldquo;An open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container.&amp;rdquo;
 In practice Docker
 povide an isolated sharable environment (dev and ship) allow to change dev env without messing-up the host OS ease an app installation is based on lxc (linux containers) and Go remove the need of a virtual machines, it can be used in a similar way but it is different â†’ much more lightweight is (quite) secure (everything is sandboxed), though I don&amp;rsquo;t like its process run as root allow you to commit changes is based on images and containers: templates and running instances (that lose memory on shutdown  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write an essay on Docker, just present it briefly and describe the best (in my opinion) way to install it on *buntu.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cineca.it/en&#34;&gt;Cineca&lt;/a&gt; workshop focused on tools to deal with big data analysis.
We had a taste of MapReduce/Hadoop/Spark and friends and we used Docker.
I wrote a small presentation to update my collegues and it become a in-progress presentation of the tools I think are
useful in our everyday work. This presentation aims of acting both as a showcase of what can help us and as a cheat sheet.
You can find it after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
