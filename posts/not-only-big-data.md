Recently I've been at a [Cineca](http://www.cineca.it/en) workshop focused on tools to deal with big data analysis. 
We had a taste of MapReduce/Hadoop/Spark and friends and we used Docker.
I wrote a small presentation to update my collegues and it become a in-progress presentation of the tools I think are 
useful in our everyday work. This presentation aims of acting both as a showcase of what can help us and as a cheat sheet.
You can find it after the break.
