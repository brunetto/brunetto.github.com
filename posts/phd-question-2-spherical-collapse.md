With this post I would like to collect and present in a simple and consistent
form some of the various analytical derivation of the spherical collapse
model, in particular the challenge was to find how to obtain the famous
$\delta_{lin}\sim1.686$.

[Here](../files/spherical_collapse2.pdf) you can find a pdf file with the analytic computation.
