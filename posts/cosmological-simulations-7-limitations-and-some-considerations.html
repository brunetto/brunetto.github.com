    <div><p><strong>Limitations</strong>    </p>
<p>In the previous posts we encountered some of the limitations of cosmological  <br>
simulations. Let's review these in detail.  <br>
First, we can consider a simulation composed of a finite box in a bigger space but to represent a real system, this box shouldn't be isolated so we use the periodic boundary conditions (<a href="http://brunettoziosi.blogspot.it/2011/11/cosmological-simulations-2-how.html" target="_blank" title="Cosmological simulations #2: how?">here</a>). This means that all the space around the box is filled with images of the box itself: a particle that leaves the box from one side will come in  <br>
from the opposite side.   <br>
<!-- TEASER_END -->  <br>
Second, the mass inside the box is not continuous. Instead, it is made by particles of mass of the order of $10^9$ solar masses. These particles represent collisionless fluid elements (made by a huge quantity of real particles) with a certain  <br>
volume and can't be treated as solid spheres. When two simulation particles are  <br>
separated by a distance smaller than the radius of the volumes they represents  <br>
they must feel less than the force coming from the entire mass (thanks to the  <br>
Gauss/Birkhoff's theorem). To do this we soften (read "we reduce") the force at  <br>
such small scales (<a href="http://brunettoziosi.blogspot.it/2011/11/cosmological-simulations-2-how.html" target="_blank" title="Cosmological simulations #2: how?">here</a>). Third, time is not continuous and its discreteness was also treated (<a href="http://brunettoziosi.blogspot.it/2011/11/cosmological-simulations-4-moving.html" target="_blank" title="Cosmological simulations: #4: Moving the particles!">here</a>) with some  <br>
criteria to decide the time steps.  <br>
Until now, however, we haven't consider the effects of taking into account  <br>
initial density fluctuations over a range of scales that is finite. In  <br>
addition to this, the finite size of the box pose a limit on the force  <br>
resolution, because fluctuations on scales bigger than the box side will not  <br>
included in the simulation due to the way the Fourier transforms act on a  <br>
period box. Some tests in literature show that the exclusion of small  <br>
scales shouldn't affect too much large scales when they reach the non linear  <br>
regime but this not holds for the exclusion of large scales, those scales bigger  <br>
than the box side. Following Bagla, the large scale exclusion should not  <br>
disturb the formation of small haloes but could change their distribution.  <br>
This effect will appear as an underestimation of the correlation function. Bagla  <br>
finds that the best way of quantifying the effects of long wave modes is to  <br>
check whether including them in the simulation will change the number of  <br>
massive haloes or not and this can be estimated using the Press-Schecther mass  <br>
function.  <br>
In Tormen&amp;Bertschinger (1996) the missing power on large scales will cause  <br>
something like a statistical cosmic bias decreasing the number of high-density  <br>
regions, the strength of the clustering and the amplitude of the peculiar  <br>
velocities.  <br>
Methods have been developed to take the missing "larger than the box" wave modes  <br>
into account and we will have a look on these in a future post.    </p>
<p><strong>Some considerations</strong>    </p>
<p>As we have seen (<a href="http://brunettoziosi.blogspot.it/2011/11/cosmological-simulations-1-why-and-what.html" target="_blank" title="Cosmological simulations #1: why and what?">here</a>) N-body cosmological simulations  <br>
are useful to understand aspects of non-linear gravitational clustering,  <br>
since it's not possible to carry out laboratory experiments in gravitational  <br>
dynamics and the analytic models fail when the system reach the non linear  <br>
regime, i.e. when the density contrast overcome the unity. Related with  <br>
cosmological simulations there are a pair of aspects that Bagla underlines in its  <br>
articles that interesting to consider.  <br>
The first issue is whether or not the gravitational clustering  <br>
erase memory of initial conditions. Is there a one-to-one correspondence between  <br>
some characterization of initial perturbations and the final state?  <br>
N-body simulations shows that gravitational clustering does not erase memory of  <br>
the initial conditions, the final power spectrum is a function of the initial  <br>
power spectrum and this relationship can be written as a one-step mapping and  <br>
the functional form of this mapping depends on the initial power spectrum.  <br>
However density profiles of massive haloes have a form independent of  <br>
initial conditions but there is a considerable scatter in density profiles  <br>
obtained from N-body simulations and it is difficult to state whether a given  <br>
functional form is always the best fit or not. I must admit that these last concepts are not very clear to me at the moment, and that I trust Bagla but I will deepen them as soon as possible to be able to comfortably master them.  <br>
The second question is if it is possible to predict the masses and distribution  <br>
of haloes that form as a result of gravitational clustering.  <br>
The initial density field is taken to be a Gaussian random field and for  <br>
hierarchical models the simple assumption that each peak undergoes collapse  <br>
independent of the surrounding density distribution can be used to estimate the  <br>
mass function and several related quantities but N-body simulations shows that  <br>
this simple set of approximations is incorrect. However, the resulting mass  <br>
function estimation is fairly accurate over a wide range of masses. Merger rates  <br>
can be thus computed using the extended Press-Schecther formalism. Modifying  <br>
some of this assumption can lead to improved predictions.    </p>
