This is good for large scale distribution of matter such as galaxy distribution or cluster formation, but if we are interested in smaller details we have to add gas physics.  &lt;br&gt;
There are two main approaches, completely different one from the other.    &lt;/p&gt;

Now we are ready to learn the algorithms developed to compute gravitational forces between the particles.    &lt;/p&gt;

It may happen that your PhD advisor ask you a question about something and you are supposed to know the answer... but you don't! Or it may happen that you have to pass an admittance/qualification exam to enter your PhD student career on general astrophysical knowledge but you can't even remember some arguments exist! Because of these consideration and for my remembrance I will Â write down some of these questions and I will try to answer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/posts/phd-question-1-m.html"&gt;Read more...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>astro/physics</category><category>cosmic_structure</category><category>Cosmology</category><category>PhD</category><category>imported</category><guid>brunetto.github.io/posts/phd-question-1-m.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cosmological simulations #2: how?</title><link>brunetto.github.io/posts/cosmological-simulations-2-how.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's try now to understand how simulations can be set up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all note that dark matter density dominates over ordinary (baryonic) matter at all times and we expect that ordinary matter follows the gravity of dark matter on large scales, so we can start considering only dark matter in our simulation.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, cosmological simulations differ from other N-body simulations because they should to be able to manage comoving coordinates, i.e. coordinates that expand with the universe, since the universe is expanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I do this because, as stressed by my PhD advisor, I need to practice in explaining in a clear way specialized knowledge and in linking it with its background and motivations. Also I would like to keep track of my progress and of what I'm learning!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, let's start with "Why we need cosmological simulations? What are they?"!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
