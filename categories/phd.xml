&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all note that dark matter density dominates over ordinary (baryonic) matter at all times and we expect that ordinary matter follows the gravity of dark matter on large scales, so we can start considering only dark matter in our simulation.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, cosmological simulations differ from other N-body simulations because they should to be able to manage comoving coordinates, i.e. coordinates that expand with the universe, since the universe is expanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I do this because, as stressed by my PhD advisor, I need to practice in explaining in a clear way specialized knowledge and in linking it with its background and motivations. Also I would like to keep track of my progress and of what I'm learning!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, let's start with "Why we need cosmological simulations? What are they?"!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
