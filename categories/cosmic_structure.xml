Now we are ready to learn the algorithms developed to compute gravitational forces between the particles.    &lt;/p&gt;

It may happen that your PhD advisor ask you a question about something and you are supposed to know the answer... but you don't! Or it may happen that you have to pass an admittance/qualification exam to enter your PhD student career on general astrophysical knowledge but you can't even remember some arguments exist! Because of these consideration and for my remembrance I will Â write down some of these questions and I will try to answer.&lt;br&gt;
